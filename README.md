# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

My motivation for this project was to succesfully learn how to clean and optimize websites.
I built this project to show that I am capable of cleaning and optimizing html and css based websites.
The problem that it solves is a better naming convention for most of the website components and a fix for one of the navigation buttons at the top of the website.
I learned how to successfully clean and optimize an html/css website.
